            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>
              I'm a passionate front end developer with a keen interest in creating intuitive and
              efficient web applications. My journey into tech started several years ago when I
              discovered the power of code to solve real-world problems. Since then, I've been
              continuously learning and growing, always seeking to expand my skill set and tackle
              new challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond coding, I believe in the importance of clear communication, teamwork, and
              maintaining a growth mindset. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead
              and the impact I can make through technology.

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Master modern web development frameworks and best practices</li>
              <li>Build production-ready applications that solve real problems</li>
              <li>Develop strong collaboration skills through team projects</li>
              <li>Learn to write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code</li>
              <li>Gain confidence in my ability to tackle complex technical challenges</li>

          <section data-testid="test-about-confidence" class="about-section">
            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>
              Growth comes from acknowledging our weaknesses and working to improve them.
              Here are areas where I'm actively working to build more confidence:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Advanced algorithm design and optimization techniques</li>
              <li>System architecture for large-scale distributed applications</li>
              <li>Public speaking and presenting technical concepts to non-technical audiences</li>
              <li>Contributing to open-source projects and navigating large codebases</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I view these challenges as opportunities for growth. Each one represents a skill
              I'm committed to developing through practice, learning, and seeking guidance from
              more experienced developers.

            <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
            <p>
              Dear Future Me,
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember this moment of uncertainty mixed with excitement. You're taking a leap into
              something new, and that takes courage. When things get challenging (and they will),
              remember why you started this journey. Remember the curiosity that drives you, the
              problems you want to solve, and the impact you want to make.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't be too hard on yourself when you encounter setbacks. Every expert was once a
              beginner. Every mistake is a lesson. Every challenge is an opportunity to grow
              stronger. Keep learning, keep building, and most importantly, keep believing in
              yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              You've got this.
            </p>

            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              One thing I've learned on this journey is that the tech community is incredibly
              supportive. There's something special about being part of a group of people who
              are all passionate about building things and solving problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm particularly excited about the intersection of technology and social impact.
              I believe that the skills we're learning can be used to make a real difference in
              people's lives, whether that's through accessibility features, educational tools,
              or applications that connect communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking ahead, I'm committed to not just becoming a better developer, but also
              becoming someone who lifts others up along the way. I want to be the kind of
              developer who writes helpful documentation, mentors newcomers, and contributes
              positively to the community.
